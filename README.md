    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The DriverPass project was a system requested to help people improve their driving test results. The client was a group trying to aid this demographic.
    They wanted a system that would allow people to shdule driving practices and access course material.
    
    What did you do particularly well?

    I outlined the requirements of the process of development well.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    My class diagram could have include functions that each piece of the system would use.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I included using a 2-step verification to the login process to ensure their information was kept safe.

    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    My main strategies focus on how best to serve the purposes of the end user and how the system maintenence can be done without interfering with processes.
